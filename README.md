# ðŸ§± Simple Blockchain in Python

This project is a **basic implementation of a Blockchain** using pure Python.  
It demonstrates the core concepts of blockchain technology such as **blocks, hashing, and chain linking** â€” without relying on any external frameworks.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Creates a **Genesis Block** (first block in the chain).
- Adds new blocks automatically to the chain.
- Each block contains:
  - Index (block number)
  - Previous block hash
  - Timestamp
  - Data (custom message)
  - Current block hash
- Uses **SHA-256 hashing** for security.
- Shows how blocks are **linked together**, making tampering evident.
